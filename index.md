Hi. I am Dongjin Seo, a student @[KAIST EE](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr). I have a dream of contributing to the world in any way(academic or industrial) to make it a better place. My research interest is mostly based on **application of Machine Learning** and **Machine Learning theory** itself. From my Bachelor and Master degree, I also acquired experience in **semiconductor** and **photonics**, respectively. I sometimes enjoy my life by playing the piano, especially with my taste on **Jazz**. [Take a look!](https://soundcloud.com/dongjin-seo-743442835)
